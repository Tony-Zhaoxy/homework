# MAE 263F — Homework 5

This repository contains the code and report for Homework 5.  
The assignment simulates the static deformation of a clamped thin beam using a discrete plate model and compares the numerical tip displacement with the Euler–Bernoulli prediction.

## Files
- **Homework5.ipynb** — Python notebook with the full simulation (bending, stretching, gravity, implicit integration).
- **Homework5_ZHAO.pdf** — Final report with required figures and analysis.

## How to Run
Open `Homework5.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab and run all cells.  
No additional files are needed.

## Results Summary
- Numerical steady displacement: **≈ 0.035 m**  
- Euler–Bernoulli prediction: **≈ 0.037 m**  
- Relative error: **≈ 5%**

The simulation matches classical beam theory with good accuracy.
